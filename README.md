# project-02
In this project we are asked to write  CSS codes to the given HTML file. It is a Food Restaurant Home Page. First I gave style to navbar using color, margin, flexbox properties etc.
I have used two font families Red Rose and Dela Gothic one in this project. In this project I have learned to make opaque background. I have acheived this by using 'rgba' color type.
